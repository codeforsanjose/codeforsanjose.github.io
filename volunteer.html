<h2>Before you join...</h2>
<div class="text-content codeOfConduct">
  <p>
    Every member is expected to <span>read and abide by</span> both our Code of Conduct
    and Anti-Harassment policy. <span>Please read them both
      carefully.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    This document is adapted from Code for America's Code of Conduct and
    Anti-Harassment Policy.
  </p>
  <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
  <p>
    The Open Source San José community expects that Open Source San José network
    activities, events, and digital forums:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Are a <span>safe</span> and <span>respectful</span> environment for all participants.</li>
    <li>Are a place where people are free to <span>
        fully express their
        identities
      </span>.</li>
    <li><span>Presume the value of others</span>. Everyone's ideas, skills, and
      contributions have value.</li>
    <li><span>Don't assume everyone has the same context</span>, and encourage
      questions.</li>
    <li>Find a way for people to be <span>productive</span> with their skills <span>
        (technical
        and not)
      </span> and energy. Use language such as <span>"yes/and,"</span> not "no/but."</li>
    <li><span>Encourage</span> members and participants to <span>listen</span> as much as they speak.</li>
    <li>Strive to build tools that are <span>
        open and free technology for public
        use</span>.</li>
    <li><span>Prioritize access</span> for and input from those who are <span>
        traditionally
        excluded from the civic process</span>.</li>
    <li>Work to ensure that the community is <span>well-represented</span> in the
      planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes
      <span>encouraging participation</span> from <span>
        women, minorities, and traditionally
        marginalized groups
      </span>.</li>
    <li><span>Actively involve community groups</span> and those with subject matter
      expertise in the decision-making process.</li>
    <li>Ensure that the <span>relationships</span> and conversations between <span>
        community
        members
      </span>, the <span>local government</span> staff and <span>community partners</span> remain
      <span>respectful, participatory, and productive</span>.</li>
    <li>Provide an environment where people are <span>
        free from discrimination
        or harassment
      </span>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Open Source San José reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of
    these policies not to participate in our
    activities, events, and digital forums.
  </p>

  <h3>Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>
  <p>
    This anti-harassment policy is based on the example <a
      href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noref">policy from the
      Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the Ada Initiative and other
    volunteers.
  </p>
  <p>
    This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio
    LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth
    Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner,
    Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the
    policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix,
    Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.
  </p>
  <p>
    All Open Source San José network activities, events, and digital forums
    and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an
    anti-harassment policy, included below.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Open Source San
    José will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an
    anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to
    offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, see this <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zg2FDt7awgfCmdcbzMwKHMb1A7KDOhs_z7ibCb3TLLQ/edit" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noref">guide from
      Code for America</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open Source San José is dedicated to providing a <span>
      harassment-free
      experience for everyone
    </span> regardless of <span>
      gender, gender identity and
      expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
      size, race, age, or religion
    </span>. <span>
      We do not tolerate harassment of staff,
      presenters, and participants in any form
    </span>. <span>
      Sexual language and imagery
      is not appropriate
    </span> for any Open Source San José event or network activity,
    including talks. <span>Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled</span>
    from Open Source San José network activities, events, and digital forums,
    at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Harassment includes but is not limited to:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Offensive verbal or written
        comments related to:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>Gender identity and expression</li>
        <li>Sexual orientation</li>
        <li>Disability</li>
        <li>Physical appearance</li>
        <li>Body size</li>
        <li>Race</li>
        <li>Religion</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
      <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
      <li>Stalking</li>
      <li>Following</li>
      <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
      <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
      <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
      <li>Unwarranted exclusion</li>
      <li>Patronizing language or action</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may
    take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
    or expulsion from Open Source San José network activities, events, and
    digital forums.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
    or have any other concerns, please contact Open Source San José Captains
    <a href="mailto:{{ site.contact.email }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noref">
      {{ site.directors | array_to_sentence_string }}
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants
    contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide
    escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
    safe for the duration of the event.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or
    it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the
    situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these
    expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
