![hack night picture](/img/first_hack_night.png)  

As of this week, there’s a new group in San Jose focused on promoting open data and creating civic tech tools for the community. Our name is Code for San Jose, and we welcome volunteers of all skills who want to use open data and technology to address real needs in our communities.

We had our first civic hack night on March 14 at a meeting venue generously provided by [NextSpace](http://nextspace.us/nextspace-san-jose/), an awesome co-working space in downtown San Jose. We plan to hold regular “civic hack” nights twice a month where members build tools, apps and data visualizations. We also plan to promote open data through special events, educational resources and policy advocacy.

We aim to become an official [Code for America brigade](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/), joining an international network of volunteers committed to making their cities better. As of January 2014, there were over 30 brigades in the US, as well as a number internationally in places like Ireland, Japan, Taiwan and Pakistan.

We’re building a community for civic hackers in San Jose. Join us.
